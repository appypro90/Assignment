# Instructions


Application Requirements:

Display available times for a meeting room booking for a user to select one time slot for a single day.
The time range the room is generally available is 9AM â€“ 5PM.
The duration for a meeting slot is 30 minutes.
The following times are already booked out and not available to select, 11AM, 12PM - 1PM, 3:30PM.

Further improvements:

As part of my further improvement, I would:
Host the app through CI/CD. 
Use db to persist the data. 
Once a slot is selected then make it unavailable. 
Add authentication. 
Add services in the UI to handle add/update etc.
